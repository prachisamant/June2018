Approach:
Solution.buildRequestResponse() : This method accepts a String url as input parameter and processes the output as required.It makes an HTTP GET call to the REST url 

Error handling:
If url is null or empty string, throws a runtime exception with error message 'Please enter a valid URL.'
If http response code is not 200 OK, throws a runtime exception with error message 'Sorry! This service is currently not available. HttpResponseCode: <responsecode>'.
If the URL is not adhering to correct format, throws a MalformedURLException with error message 'The URL is malformed. Please enter a valid url.';
Other exceptions considered here are ProtocolException, IOException, ParseException,
