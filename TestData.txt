Test Data used for verifying the code is as follows: 

Test 1:
Sample url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/
Sample output: 
Displaying all of the keys for each JSON document :
website address phone name company id email username : Sum of numbers = 0
website address phone name company id email username : Sum of numbers = 0
website address phone name company id email username : Sum of numbers = 0
website address phone name company id email username : Sum of numbers = 0
website address phone name company id email username : Sum of numbers = 0
website address phone name company id email username : Sum of numbers = 0
website address phone name company id email username : Sum of numbers = 0
website address phone name company id email username : Sum of numbers = 0
website address phone name company id email username : Sum of numbers = 0
website address phone name company id email username : Sum of numbers = 0
Running Total = 0
Note: The above test url does not contain a key "numbers", which is why the sum and running total are 0.

Test 2:
Sample input JSON Array used for testing:
[
	{
		"id":1, 
		"name":"john",
		"numbers":[3,5,7,15],
		"status":"married"
	},
	{
		"id":2, 
		"name":"mary",
		"numbers":[6,8,10,2],
		"status":"married"
	},
	{
		"id":3, 
		"name":"julie",
		"numbers":[10,3,8,9],
		"status":"single"
	}
]

Sample output:
Displaying all of the keys for each JSON document :
name numbers id status : Sum of numbers = 30
name numbers id status : Sum of numbers = 26
name numbers id status : Sum of numbers = 30
Running Total = 86
